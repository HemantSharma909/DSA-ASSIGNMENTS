/*
With reference to above example of circular linked list.
Line 24 i.e. while(temp->next!=head){temp=temp->next;} establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first element.
We Know that in circular linked list last node of linked list points to head of that linked list, hence we can check if any node points to head of linked list then that node is the end of circular linked list.

/*Q2)  What are the practical applications of a circular linked list? 
Practical applications of circular linked list are :
1)Computing Resources: Circular Linked Lists is used to manage the computing resources of the computer.
2)Multiplayer Games: All the Players are kept in a Circular Linked List and the pointer keeps on moving forward as a player's chance ends..
3)Computer Networking:Circular linked list is also used in computer networking for token scheduling.
4)Fionacci Heap: Circular Linked List is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as a Fibonacci Heap.
5)Implementation of Data Structure: Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
6)Audio/Video Streaming: Circular linked list is also used in audio and video streaming,for ex. when one copmlete audio list finishes playing in music player then it again starts playing from start.
